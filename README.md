# raterhood-application

IDEA:
We have created a web-based application that provides comprehensive information about a particular neighborhood in a city. This can be a great help for people who are planning to move or rent out a flat. Our application is designed to provide information on the building's condition, the neighborhood's population density, the availability and cost of parking, public transportation options, and infrastructure. Additionally, we are including new functionalities such as reviews from people who live in the area, which could offer valuable insights and help others make informed decisions.
To make your application more user-friendly, we consider creating an intuitive interface that allows users to easily access the information they need. We consider to include features that enable users to customize their search based on their specific needs and preferences. For example, users could filter their search by crime rate, walkability, schools, or nearby attractions.
To ensure the accuracy and reliability of your application, we may partner with local organizations, businesses, or government agencies to obtain up-to-date information on the neighborhood's attributes. Additionally, we would like to add user feedback and ratings to keep the information current and relevant.
Overall, creating a comprehensive and user-friendly web-based application that provides information on a city's neighborhoods can be a valuable resource for people who are looking to move or rent out a flat. By offering new functionalities and incorporating user feedback, our goal is to set the application apart from existing resources and provide a valuable service to our users.
IMPLEMENTATION:
* To get started, we are designing a database schema, which would include tables for neighborhoods, reviews, and other relevant data. We are using PostgreSQL to create and manage our database.
* Next, we are creating the backend using Java with Spring. Use Spring Boot to quickly set up our server and handle requests from your frontend. Spring Data JPA can be used to interact with our database, and Spring Security can be used to manage authentication and authorization.
* For the frontend, we are going to work with React to build a user-friendly interface for the application. React provides a powerful and flexible way to create complex UIs.
FEATURES:
* About / Contact page
* Menu bar
* Search Engine
* Review page
* Cities page with description / reviews
* Current location's time and weather
* Register / Log in page
* Map of the current city
PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES:
